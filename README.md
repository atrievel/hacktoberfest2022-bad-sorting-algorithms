A collection of bad (or just plain hilarious) sorting algorithms for ðŸŽƒ Hacktoberfest 2022 ðŸŽƒ

## But why?

Most projects during Hacktoberfest focus on implementing optimal solutions for various problems. I thought it would be a fun challenge to implement a collection of "bad" sorting algorithms instead. I strongly believe in learning by doing, even if it means discovering inefficient ways of accomplishing a task.

Below are a list of what I could find to be some of the most hilarious sorting algorithms.

## List of algorithms

- [Bubble sort (not necessarily bad, just an example)](https://github.com/atrievel/hacktoberfest2022-bad-sorting-algorithms/blob/main/src/algorithms/bubble-sort.ts)
  - Implemented by [atrievel](https://github.com/atrievel)
- Sleep sort ([issue here](https://github.com/atrievel/hacktoberfest2022-bad-sorting-algorithms/issues/16))

## Contributing

Feel free to browse any of the unassigned open issues, post a comment and @ me saying you'd like to work on it, and I'll assign you as soon as I can.
I do work a full time job and have a bunch of other hobbies, but feel free to ping me again if I don't get back to you within 24 hours.

Please remember to follow the guidelines in the issue and the PR guidelines in the [./github](https://github.com/atrievel/hacktoberfest2022-bad-sorting-algorithms/tree/main/.github) directory.

I'll only assign one issue per username to keep things fair and so everyone has a chance to learn ðŸ˜…

## Help

I realize programming may be new to some of the people that take on these issues, so never hesitate to reach out for help often and early. Learning is the whole point of Hacktoberfest!
