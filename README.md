A collection of bad (or just plain hilarious) sorting algorithms for Hacktoberfest 2022

## But why?
Most projects during Hacktoberfest focus on implementing optimal solutions for various problems. I though it would be a fun challenge to implement a collection of "bad" sorting algorithms instead. Bellow are a list of what I could find to be some of the most hilarious sorting algorithms.

## List of algorithms
* Sleep sort
* Bogo sort
* Bozo sort
* Quantum Bogosort
* Domino sort
* Dictator sort
* Solar bitflip sort
* Spaghetti Sort
* Slow sort
* API sort
* Stooge sort
